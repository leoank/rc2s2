# saarthi ctl

`saarthi ctl` is a command-line client of the hub: everything the app does, from a
terminal or a script. It needs the hub's address and a file holding a client token. Put
them in `~/.config/saarthi/ctl.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/saarthi/ctl.toml`) once:

```toml
hub = "http://hub:7700"
token_file = "~/.config/saarthi/client-token"
```

The token stays in its own file, so the config holds no secret. `--hub` and
`--token-file`, or the environment variables `SAARTHI_HUB` and `SAARTHI_TOKEN_FILE`, override
the file for one call: a flag wins over its variable, and both win over the file.

Commands that act on something take the node by name or by id, and the request or
session by its id, as the listings print them.

## Looking

```console
$ saarthi ctl nodes
34c8448e45f342e285d99386e9882fb5  laptop  0.1.0  connected  spawn: /Users/me/workspace
$ saarthi ctl sessions          # live sessions; --all for every session the hub knows
$ saarthi ctl pending           # permission requests and questions waiting
$ saarthi ctl watch             # print every change until Ctrl-C
```

## Deciding

```console
$ saarthi ctl allow laptop <request id>
$ saarthi ctl deny laptop <request id> --message "use the staging bucket instead"
$ saarthi ctl answer laptop <request id> --answer "Which database?=Postgres"
```

`answer` takes `--answer "<question>=<answer>"` once per question; for a multi-select
question, repeat it once per label you pick. An answer that is not one of the options is
passed to Claude as free text.

## Steering

```console
$ saarthi ctl prompt laptop <session id> "run the tests again"
$ saarthi ctl interrupt laptop <session id>
$ saarthi ctl interrupt laptop <session id> --then "stop, try the other approach"
$ saarthi ctl kill laptop <session id>
```

`interrupt` works on sessions under `saarthi run` and sessions started from a client;
`kill` on any session (a plain `claude` gets SIGTERM). Each command prints `ok`, or `ok:`
followed by a note from the node, for example when a prompt is held for approval in a
bypass-permissions session, or the reason it could not be done.

## Starting sessions and switching keep-awake

```console
$ saarthi ctl spawn laptop ~/workspace/app "fix the failing test" --model sonnet
0b6c3f1e-6d0e-4c1a-9a51-1f2f6c3d8e77
$ saarthi ctl spawn laptop ~/workspace/new-idea --create      # made first, starts idle
$ saarthi ctl spawn laptop ~/workspace/app "tidy the imports" --permission-mode bypassPermissions
$ saarthi ctl spawn laptop ~/workspace/app "try the new parser" --profile sandbox
$ saarthi ctl keep-awake laptop on
```

```console
$ saarthi ctl history --node laptop --limit 10    # newest first: id, start, directory, first prompt
$ saarthi ctl resume laptop <session id> "and now the docs"
```

`resume` continues a finished session in place, idle without a prompt; see
[Resuming a session](sessions.md#resuming-a-session).

`spawn` starts a headless session in a directory under one of the node's spawn roots
(the `spawn:` column of `nodes`) and prints its id, for `prompt`, `interrupt` and `kill`. Without a prompt the session
starts idle; `--create` makes a missing directory under the root first;
`--permission-mode` takes any mode `claude --permission-mode` does (`acceptEdits`, `plan`,
`bypassPermissions`, ...); `--profile` names one of the node's launch profiles, such as a
sandbox (see [Sandboxed sessions](../setup/node.md#sandboxed-sessions)).
The path is the node's, and `~` there is the node's home. See
[Starting a session](sessions.md#starting-a-session). `keep-awake on` or `off` switches the
node's keep-awake hold, as the switch on its health screen does.

Every command and flag is in the [command line reference](../reference/cli.md).
