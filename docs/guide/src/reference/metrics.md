# Health metrics

What a node reports in each health sample, every 30 seconds by default
(`--health-secs`). A metric that does not apply on a machine (a GPU on Linux, the rate
limits without a Claude login) is simply absent.

| Metric | Unit | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu.util_pct` | % | CPU utilisation across all cores since the last sample |
| `cpu.load_1m` | | One-minute load average |
| `mem.used_bytes`, `mem.total_bytes` | bytes | Memory in use and installed |
| `swap.used_bytes` | bytes | Swap in use |
| `disk.used_bytes`, `disk.total_bytes` | bytes | The disk holding the home directory |
| `net.rx_bytes`, `net.tx_bytes` | bytes | Received and sent on all interfaces since the last sample |
| `gpu.util_pct` | % | GPU device utilisation (macOS) |
| `gpu.mem_used_bytes` | bytes | GPU memory in use (macOS) |
| `claude.processes` | | Running Claude Code processes |
| `node.keep_awake` | 0 or 1 | Whether the daemon is holding the machine awake (with `--keep-awake`) |
| `usage.five_hour_pct` | % | Claude 5-hour window used |
| `usage.seven_day_pct` | % | Claude 7-day window used |
| `usage.seven_day_fable_pct` | % | Claude 7-day Fable window used |
| `usage.<window>_resets_s` | Unix seconds | When each of the three windows resets |
| `usage.age_s` | seconds | Age of the usage numbers: 0 when polled live (`--claude-usage`), otherwise the age of Claude Code's own cached copy |

The app charts CPU, memory, GPU, disk, load, network in and out (as MB/s, from the bytes
since the previous sample and the time between the two) and the three usage windows. The
hub keeps every sample in its `health` table.
