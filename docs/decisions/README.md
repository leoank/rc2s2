# Decisions

One architecture decision record per file, `ADR-0001-short-title.md`, numbered in order
and never renumbered. A decision that changes an earlier one supersedes it; both stay.

ADR-0001 to ADR-0012 record the owner's answers in `../architecture-questions.md`
(2026-10-16); ADR-0013 to ADR-0018 the choices the phase 0 experiments settled; the rest
were made while building phase 1 (ADR-0024 to ADR-0026 with the owner's choices for
step 5); ADR-0027 to ADR-0032 came from using the app, with the owner's answers of
2026-10-25 (phase 1.5); ADR-0033 is the user guide (2026-10-26); ADR-0034 plans phase 2
with the owner's answers of 2026-11-06, ADR-0035 follows their first use of it,
ADR-0036 is step 2, history and resume, and ADR-0037 fixes spawned sessions' permission
requests and adds a permission mode to a spawn. ADR-0038 starts phase 3 with sandboxed
spawns, with the owner's answers of 2026-11-07.
