## Question
A session the owner spawned on rogue failed every tool that needed approval, and nothing
reached the app: rogue's `~/.claude/settings.json` had lost rc2s2's hook block. Can the
spawner give its sessions the PermissionRequest hook itself, through `--settings`, and
does that double up when the user's settings carry the same hook? Which flags start a
headless session in bypass mode, for the owner's request to spawn with
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`?

## Hypothesis and predictions
Without a hook, `claude -p` refuses a tool that needs approval at once. A PermissionRequest
hook from `--settings` is asked like one from the settings file ([[EXP-20261016-rq1405]]
found the hook fires in `-p` mode); identical hooks from two sources are asked once. If the
`--settings` hook is not asked, the spawner needs the SDK's `can_use_tool` callback instead.
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` and `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` both bypass, and
the hook is not asked.

## Plan
1. A local HTTP server stands in for the node's hook endpoint and answers allow or deny.
2. Per case, a fresh directory under `target/live-work-perm-exp` and one stream-json
   `claude -p` (haiku) asked to run one Bash command that writes `probe.txt`: no hook; the
   hook through `--settings` answering allow, then deny; the hook both through
   `--settings` and in the directory's `.claude/settings.json`; the skip flag; the modes
   `bypassPermissions`, `acceptEdits` and `plan`.
3. Record the session's `permissionMode` from `init`, the hook calls, whether the file was
   written, and the result's `permission_denials`.

## Success criteria
The `--settings` hook is asked exactly once per request and its answer decides; both bypass
flags run the command without a hook call.

## Runs
One line per run after its link, what was tried and what it showed; `yajna validate`
rejects a bare link here. Metric runs also land in results.tsv.
- [[RUN-20261106-qtaf57]] eight cases on Claude Code 2.1.318: no hook refused at once; the `--settings` hook asked once and obeyed (twice for a deny, when the model retried), once also with a project copy; both bypass flags ran unasked; plan ran nothing

## Conclusion
Written once, by a human, when status becomes `concluded`.
