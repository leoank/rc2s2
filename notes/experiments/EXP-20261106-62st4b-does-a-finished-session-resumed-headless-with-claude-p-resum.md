## Question
Phase 2 step 2 resumes a finished session from the phone through the spawner. Whether the
app shows the resumed session as the same conversation or a new one depends on what
`claude -p --resume <id>` over stream-json does to the session's identity, which
[[EXP-20261016-rq1405]] checked only for a plain `-p` resume on an older Claude Code.

## Hypothesis and predictions
H1: the resumed process keeps the session id, appends to the same transcript, keeps the
context, and registers under that id. If it forks a new id or file, the hub has to link
the new session to the old one and the app show them as one.

## Plan
1. `notes/runs/RUN-20261106-632b3d/run.sh`: a one-turn session that is told a code word,
   then the same id resumed over stream-json and asked for the word; compare the init's
   session id, the registry entry and the transcript files before and after.

## Success criteria
- The init and the registry carry the original id, the reply has the code word, and the
  original transcript grows with no new file.

## Runs
One line per run after its link, what was tried and what it showed; `yajna validate`
rejects a bare link here. Metric runs also land in results.tsv.
- [[RUN-20261106-632b3d]] a code word kept across a headless resume on 2.1.318: same id in init and registry, transcript 31 to 41 lines, no new file; H1 holds

## Conclusion
Written once, by a human, when status becomes `concluded`.
